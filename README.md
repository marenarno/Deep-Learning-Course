# Medical Image Segmentation: Head and Neck Tumor Segmentation
TDT4265: Mini-Project

This project focuses on medical image segmentation, specifically Head and Neck Tumor Segmentation, using deep learning techniques. The goal is to automatically segment tumors in MRI scans to assist in radiation therapy (RT) planning, reducing manual effort and improving accuracy.

## Project Overview

This repository contains an implementation of a deep learning model for **tumor segmentation** in MRI images, using **2D and 3D MedMNIST datasets**. The project applies **U-Net** architecture for segmentation tasks, with a focus on medical images.

### Objective:
- **Segment tumors** from MRI images (Head and Neck Cancer dataset).
- Implement a custom **segmentation model** for medical images.
- Evaluate model performance using the **DICE coefficient**.

## Datasets

### MedMNIST Datasets:
- **2D Dataset**: We use **BloodMNIST** from the MedMNIST collection, a dataset of 2D medical images.
- **3D Dataset**: **OrganMNIST**, which consists of 3D medical image data.

The datasets are used to train and evaluate the model on medical image segmentation tasks.
